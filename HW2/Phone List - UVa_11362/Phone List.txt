Description:
To find if on of the phone numbers is another phone number substring (starting from the beginning)
we simply need to receive all phone numbers into a vector, sort the vector which will make all substring (that start from the beginning)
be placed next to each other where the small string will be before longer ones (lexicographic order)
then simply check if one string is substring of the one after it by using find function of string.

Time Complexity : for each text case where n is the number of phone numbers
sorting - o(nlogn)
finding substring - (each string is length 10 max) - O(1)
going through all sorted array - O(n)
Total - O(nlogn)
