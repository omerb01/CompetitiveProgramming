Description:
Given a polygon, implement shamo's algorithm to find the minimum width of the polygon ("will the sofa pass the door?")
using :
- convex hull algorithm to sort the points of the polygon
- find antipodal pair
- iterate all the antipodal pairs and output the min width

Time Complexity :
Given n - number of points in the polygon.
convex hull is O(n^2)
iterating the antipodal points is O(n) as we saw in class
then total is O(n^2)
