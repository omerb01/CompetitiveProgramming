Description:
Given a dictionary, using a comparator (as defined : 1.length, 2.lex, 3.index) sort the dictionary.
then, for each test case :
	- get substring.
	- iterate the sorted dictionary, and find 10 strings which has the following substring.
	- found 1 or more -> print its indexes. else -> print -1.

Time Complexity :
Given - n length of dictionary, m number of testcases.
sorting the dictionary is n*logn.
iterating for each test case is worst case O(n). so for all of them is O(mn)
then, total is O(mn + nlogn).
