Description:
After we take all the points, we will sort them (by their x value, and y next which is the default sort of a pair) and calc the mid point between first point and last point, second and n-1 and so on and so on ...
If all mid points are the same then we have a center of symmetry.

Time :
Receiving all points - O(n)
Sorting - O(nlogn)
Calculation - O(n)

Total : O(nlogn)
