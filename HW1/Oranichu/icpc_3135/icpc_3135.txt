Description:
Map keeps it's elements sorted so i will make sure to give the map a type that it's first element will hold the next query.
Map elemnts will be consisted of <<a,b>,c> when b is the querty ID number, c is the original input Period and a is like a stacking sum of periods.
by adding periods we can tell what is the next query to be printed, because map keeps it's elements sorted we just need to pop the first element then put a new element back where a = a + c (the next wait time).
And do that for K times.
Time Complexity -
inserting to map - O(nlogn)
Total - O(nlogn)
