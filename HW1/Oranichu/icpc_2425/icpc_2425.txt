Description:
Instead of building the graph like it's inputed and calculating the shortest path each time,
Iv'e build the reversed graph and calculated all the shortest paths from exit using Dijkstra as given in the aux material.

Then just run and see which graph node distance from exit is smaller than the given time.

Time : for each one of the test cases cases(let's assume there are K test cases) where N is number of nodes and E is number of edges.
init graph - O(N+E)
Dijkstra - O(N+ElogN)
cheking time - O(N)

total (K* (N+ElogN))
