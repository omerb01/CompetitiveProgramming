Description:
Iv'e kept 3 types of vectors:
1. Original values vector.
2. A vector that contains all the indexes if Zeros. (sorted)
3. A vector that contains all the indexes if Negative values. (sorted)

With every change i check according to it's previous value compared to it's new value and accordingly update the vectors in O(logn) using lower_bound function.
When we get a P and need to print result i first check if there's a zero in the range given, if not then i check if the number of negative values in that given range is even or odd and print + or - accordingly.

Time complexity for each case -
building vectors - O(n)
changing values - O(logn)
printing after P command - O(logn)
Total - O(n) for receiving input and O(logn) for printing result.
