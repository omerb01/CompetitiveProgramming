Description:

If we write down all first 100 binary numbers in rows we can see a rule that happends :
example with 10 first :
    2^3 --- 2^2 --- 2^1 --- 2^0
     0       0       0       0
     0       0       0       1
     0       0       1       0
     0       0       1       1
     0       1       0       0
     0       1       0       1
     0       1       1       0
     0       1       1       1
     1       0       0       0
     1       0       0       1
as you can see here there are seq of one 1's in the 2^0 (=1) col
and a seq of two 1's in the 2^1 (=2) col and so on ...
if we take 8 for example we can know there's 3*(2^2) one's before it.
we just need to calc the number of one's till the current number from the closest power of 2 to it
by repeating this recursively, but depending on the number of one's it has in it.

Total time: for each of the k test cases :
count ones of a and b - log(a) + log(b) = log(b)

Total : k * log(b)
