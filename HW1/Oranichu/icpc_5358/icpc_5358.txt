Description :
The 8 Queens Chess Problem on a 8x8 board has only 92 solutions,
So the most simple solution is to save all possible solutions to the problem in an array and do a search in the 92 array elements (each element is an output line that contains 8 indexes),
And search for all the solutions where the given queen is placed and print them with the desired output format.
Time complecity for each test case -

Filling the array - O(1) board is 8x8.
Checking the array - O(1) only 92 options.
