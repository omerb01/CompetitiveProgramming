implemented using back-tracking. recursive Algorithm as described :
1. if we are after the last column - legal solution. print it.
2. if queen is already set, call recursive with next column
3. otherwise :
	3.1 for each row, try to set a queen if and only if it is legal
	3.2 mark partial solution
	3.3 call recursive with column+1
	3.4 unmark last queen
	** in this methos, we are checking all the relevant options, and skipping illegal options.
