Implemented a struct with 3 integers : query_id, first and time,
and a comparing algorithm according to the description.
then, using priority queue, do x times :
- pop the best option (usually with minimum time) and print it
- update time (time=time+first)
- push it back
Complexity :
n - number of queries, assuming number of iterations is const
make_heap - O(n)
const times O(logn) - pop and push elements from the heap
total : O(n)
