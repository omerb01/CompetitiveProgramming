implemented 2 arrays of "willing" and "actual", which were maintained during the process.
then, as long as price > 0 do :
1. calc price_per_ppl (the ideal amount assuming everyboddy has enough many)
2. make priority heap sorted by (first-left from what is willing to give, second-index)
3. then, pop each element from the heap, assign it as much money as can, but no more than price_per_ppl
4. upadte all fields accordingly and return to stage 1.
trigger for IMPOSSIBLE : in the end of the process, price is still more than 0.

Complexity :
assuming price is a constant. n is number of paricipants.
- make heap O(n)
- heap manipulations O(nlogn)
total O(nlogn)
